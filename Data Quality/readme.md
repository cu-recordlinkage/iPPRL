# **Incremental Privacy Preserving Record Linkage (iPPRL) Aim 4**

PCORI Methods contract ME-2018C1-11287, was awarded to co-principle investigators Toan Ong PnD and Michael Kahn MD, PhD at the University of Colorado Anschuz Medical Campus (CU-AMC) to implement and study the use of incremental record record linkage techniques for both clear text record linkage (CTRL) and privacy preserving record linkage (PPRL). Using data sets obtained from the Colorado Congenital Heart Disease Registry (COCHO: PI: Teressa Crume PhD) and from Children's Hospital Colorado (CHCO) and UCHealth (UCHealth), this body of work compared record linkage performance using standard (bulk) linkage (CTRL, PPRL) and incremental linkage (iCTRL, iPPRL). The objective was to determine if incremental record linkage had linkage accuracy similar to bulk linkage. Because incremental linkage moves much less data between a data provider and a linkage Honest Broker, incremental methods are to be preferred if performance is equivlent. More information about this body of work can be found on the project's public facing GitHub site. Technical details are posted on in the project's GitHub wiki.

This Jupyter Lab notebook embodies the analytics used to explore Aim 4 of the above PCORI Methods contract.

**Aim 4: Calculate and compare data quality (DQ) measures of completeness density, and plausibility in unlinked and linked data using temporally partitioned COCHD data sets created in Aim 4.**

This notebook uses a data set containing full personal health information (PHI) as defined by the Department of Health and Human Services HIPAA regulations. Thus, the underlying data sets cannot be made available. This notebook only runs within the secure EUREKA analytics environment maintained by Health Data Compass in the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine at CU-AMC. However, the logic for analyzing data quality before and after record linkage is generic. A sample data set based on synthetic data will be added to this notebook at a future date.

```
# Select which record linkage method to be analyzed
ctrl = ['job_28433','ctrl']
ictrl = ['job_28798','ictrl']
ipprl = ['job_26137','ipprl']
pprl = ['job_27970','pprl']

rl_type = ipprl

if rl_type[1] in ['ctrl','pprl']:
    incremental = False
else: 
    incremental = True
```

## Data quality measures in Record linkage
The core DQ idea is to compare DQ measures using unlinked rows versus linked rows.

* Linkage can occur at:
    * the network level - denoted as by_nid
    * the patient level - denoted as by_sid
* Unlikned clinical encounter data are denoted as by_encnum

This work defines four data quality measures that can be calculated for both linked and unlinked data:
1. Data Completeness
2. Data Density
3. Value Density
4. Observation Period Durations Completeness

Many other DQ concepts exist but not all have equivalent computational analogues in both unlinked and linked data. The most difficult issue in creating DQ measures that are comparable between unlinked and linked data is determining the correct denominator to use across measures and runs. Each DQ measure defined here as its denominator described in the Python function that calculates its values.

### Assumptions:
1. Record linkage has been performed and linkages are stored in a schema and table called .network_id
2. Clinical data exists in two formats:
    *  each incremental data load is in a separate table
    *  there exists a table that contains cumulative data from the first data load to the current data load
3. The JupyterLab notebook Aim4_Data_Partition_Scripts will help create these scripts from the existing data sets


## Changelog
* 2021-06-20: All DQ runs for iPPRL, iCTRL, PPRL and CTRL executed
* 2021-06-15: SQL for Completeness/Data Density reimplemented as one query.
* 2021-05-26: Replaced network_id with last_network_id for each run to get "final" NID for that run
* 2021-05-27: Reran data sets to use startdate for time cutoffs. No longer using enddate for anything
* 2021-06-02: Josh converted one-shot run to loop over 17 runs; created final data structures for all run


## Technical Preamble: Description of Initial Data Set & Variables naming conventions
![alt text](https://github.com/cu-recordlinkage/iPPRL/blob/master/images/technicalpreamble.png)

* Data aggregated at the NID level are "network linked". Variables are named "_by_nid"
* Data aggregated at the ID/SID level are "patient linked". Variables are named "_by_studyid"

**ALL ANALYSES ARE PERFORMED ON THE COHORT OF PATIENTS THAT PARTICIPATED IN AT LEAST ONE LINKAGE. PATIENTS THAT DID NOT LINK ("SINGLETONS") ARE REMOVED FROM THESE CALCULATIONS.**

In the above diagram, NID_1/UID_10 would not be included in the analytic cohort because NID_1 ultimately links back to only a single Person record (StudyID=100)
UID_20 and UID_21 are linked via NID_2. These two UIDs link to the same patient record (ID_200 / StudyID_200). This NID will also not be included
UID_30, UID_31, and UID_32 are linked via NID_2. UID_30 and UID_31 link to the same patient record but UIC_32 links to a different patient record. THhus NID_3 links two different patient records (StudyID_300 and StudyID_400). NIC3 will be included in the linkage cohort
We can use the cardinality of StudyID (n_sid) to determine linkage status

**Justification:** This study is examining how record linkage alters DQ measures. Patients who never link are not the focus of this study. Also since the number of linkages is much smaller than non-linkages, removing the non-linked patient allows DQ changes to be seen.

TECHNICAL NOTE: Network_IDs associated with a UID may change across runs. Thus for the current run, the most recently assigned network_id should be used for each UID. Tofind this, need to find the last run_id with an assigned network_id for every UID. The network_id assigned as the last_run_id is the assigned network_id for the current run. Thus, we query for max(run_id) group by UID and use that to assign max_nid.

EXAMPLE: UID 10 is assigned NID=1111 in Run 1, assigned NID=3333 in Run 2, and assigned NID=6666 in the final run.

* For Run 1, the correct NID is max(run_id)=1 where run_id <=1
* For Run 2, the correct NID is max(run_id)=2 where run_id <=2
* For Run 3, the correct NID is max(run_id)=3 where run_id <=3

## Broad Overview: A look at the linkage results
* Patient-level linkage has occurred when #(SID)>2 for a NID
* Encounter-level linkage has occurred when #(ENC_ID) > 2 for a NID (network linkage) or >2 for a SID (patient linkage)
* Because each data increment increases the number of patients and encounters, the number of patient and encounter linkages grows across each incremental data load
    * We show both the count of linkages and normalized linkages (each run sums to 100%) to eliminate effect of incremental data
* In the following plots:
    * X-axis: number of entities (patients or encounters) in a link
    * Y-axis: number or precentage of linkages (patients or encounters) that have this number of entities
    * Example in English: "There are 15 linkages (Y) that link together 3(X) patients would appear as a bar graph X=3, Y=15

## DQ Measure: COMPLETENESS:
Completeness calculates the presence/absence of a data value without regard to its value. For unlinked rows, either a value is present or it is not. For linked data, a value in at least one linked member of the linked set is sufficient to say that a value is present for that link.

Completeness is reported as a percent: # with value present / Total #. The numerators & denominators are different for unlinked and linked:

   * Unlinked (left figure): Denominator = Number of rows by_sid (patient) or by_enc_id (encounter); Numerator = Number of rows by_sid or by_enc_id with a non-NULL value
   * Linked (right figure): Denominator = Number of Linked Network_IDs (network); Numerator = Number of Linked Network_IDs with at least one non-NULL row (Count by_nid)

NOTE: This metric does not look if multiple linked values in linked data agree. This feature is examined in value density.

![alt text](https://github.com/cu-recordlinkage/iPPRL/blob/master/images/labnotebook.png)

Completeness is computed in two steps: Counts and Percentage. The Completness measure is percent.
This query only calculates count. Percentages are calculated using Pandas
Completness is calculated for patient-level linkage variables(lvs by_sid) and for encounter-level clinical variables (clinvs by_enc_id)
